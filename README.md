# landing-page

This project was created to primarily practice my css flexbox knowledge. The end result of this project is to replicate a given landing page.

Reflection: Everything was relatively easy except for getting the spacing to work. 
Divs would fall off the page or not move at all when resizing the window.
This was fixed with width 100% and max-width.
